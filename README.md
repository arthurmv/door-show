# door&show
Very simple JavaScript script for hide and unhide buttons or whatever you like to use doing mouseover.

## How to use it?
Just set IDs to any object or container in your HTML file following these points
* The key item must be named `door` in ID field followed by any number from 1 to 10. (door1...door2...door3...)
* Items to be shown or hidden must be named as `door`s but using `show` instead. (show1...show2...show3...)
